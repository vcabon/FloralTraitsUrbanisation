This repository provides R codes and data to reproduce the analysis described in the submitted manuscript "Urbanisation modulates the attractiveness of plant communities to pollinators by filtering for floral traits". The analysis aims to understand to which extent floral traits known to attract pollinators are filtered by abiotic versus biotic factors in urban environments. The dataset contains information about 47 study sites ditributed along an urbanisation gradient in Berlin and surrounding, Germany.  

# Data

The provided dataset (Data/ANALYSES_floral_traits_urbanisation.csv) contains the metrics describing the investigated floral traits, as well as the measurments of the abiotic and biotic factors describing the urban environment, tested as predictors in the analysis.

# Run the scripts

Run the main script (Scripts/Main_run_analysis.R) will load the needed R-packages, import the data, run the models and export the plots used as illustrations in the manuscript. The figures in .PNG format are exported in the Export/ folder.
